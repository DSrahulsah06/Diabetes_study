Learning how to use Machine Learning to help us predict whether a patient is suffering from diabetes or not ?
About one in seven U.S. adults has diabetes now, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But by 2050, that rate could skyrocket to as many as one in three. With this in mind, learning how to use Machine Learning to help us predict Diabetes. Let’s get started!

k-Nearest Neighbors
The k-NN algorithm is arguably the simplest machine learning algorithm. Building the model consists only of storing the training data set. To make a prediction for a new data point, the algorithm finds the closest data points in the training data set — its “nearest neighbors.”
